# Deep-learning-basics

Deep learning first assignment answers.<Br/>

<hr/>

The goal of this assignment is to make us familiar with MLP architechture and the different techniques which can be used to improve our model training in different situations. For example by adding some dropout layers or adding batch normalization techniques or other regularization methods we can make the model ready to train deeper neural networks and the ones with much more parameters to learn.
<br/>
There is also a section to work with camera with we can use openCV there to do that task. but in this version, I have a novel method to catch the live stream from user camera and do other stuffs on the colab processors.
<br/>
This is just a Homework, but there can be lots of things that you can learn from it. I hope so.
